# PromptArchitect AI 🏛️ v3.5

**PromptArchitect AI** is a professional-grade prompt engineering suite designed to bridge the gap between messy human intent and high-performance machine reasoning. It utilizes advanced meta-prompting techniques to optimize instructions for the world's most capable models, powered primarily by **Google Gemini (gemini-flash-lite-latest)**.

## 🚀 The Reasoning Protocol v3.5

PromptArchitect doesn't just "write prompts." It applies a multi-layered **Structured Intent Engine** to every input:

1.  **Identity Injection**: Assigns specialized expert personas with specific cognitive boundaries.
2.  **Context Anchoring**: Establishes strict knowledge environments to prevent hallucinations.
3.  **Reasoning Triggers**: Injects Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic patterns to force deeper analysis.
4.  **Schema Synthesis**: Enforces structured outputs (JSON, XML, Markdown) via syntax alignment.

## 🛠️ Specialized Toolkit

The platform is divided into five high-performance modules:

### 1. 📐 Prompt Architect (Flagship)
Transform vague ideas into multi-layered system instructions. Tailored specifically for the unique architecture of **Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **Claude**.

### 2. 💻 DevAgent Scripter
Master AI coding agents like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and **Copilot**. Features tech-stack auto-detection and "Anti-Lazy" enforcement to ensure agents don't skip code or hallucinate file paths.

### 🛡️ Prompt Sentinel
An AI Red Teaming suite. Automatically generates adversarial injections, jailbreaks, and logic traps to audit your prompts for security and robustness.

### 4. 🌐 Perplexity Architect
Optimizes research queries for deep web analysis. Forces academic citations and utilizes specific search operators (`site:`, `filetype:`) to filter out SEO noise.

### 5. ⚙️ Workflow Architect
The bridge between visual automation and agentic logic. Analyzes **n8n** workflow descriptions (or screenshots) to generate precise Tool Definitions and System Prompts.
